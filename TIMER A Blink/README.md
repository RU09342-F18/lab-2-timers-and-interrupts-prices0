# Timer A Blink
This part of the lab the task was to have 2 LEDs toggling on and off at different speeds, this was done on two different MSP430 boards the G2553 and the FR2311. This was done by using two timers and two CCR's (capture control registers), setting each CCR to a different speed (clock cylce).
## Inputs/Outputs

Outputs: P1.0 LED, P1.6 LED
### MSP430FR2311
